# Quick Summary of Fork

Fork was created to add serial1 commands to an attached EMIC2. This lets us send text that will be spoken aloud by our nodebot. Canned phrases are spoken by sending pin states of 0-3 to pin 120, which is not a real pin. Realtime text will be done (NOT IMPLEMENTED) by adding a new BLE characteristic. 

# ble-io

Ble-io is a library for writing javascript programs that interact with Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) devices. It can also be used an [IO plugin](https://github.com/rwaldron/io-plugins) for use with the [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) robotics framework.

The intention is to be able to use a simple and generic API for interacting with the GPIO pins across many different types of BLE peripherals.

Ble-io was built at [IcedDev](http://iceddev.com/)


## Installation

`npm install ble-io`

## Getting Started

In order to use the ble-io library, you will need to load a firmware onto the BLE peripheral that supports the ble-io Service and Characteristics described [here](https://github.com/monteslu/ble-io/blob/master/service.md).

One implementation of the ble-io service is for Intel curie based boards including the Arduino 101 and TinyTile here: [firmware](https://github.com/monteslu/ble-io/tree/master/arduino/curie)

## Usage

```js
const BleIO = require("ble-io");
const io = new BleIO();

io.on("ready", function() {
  //turn on pin 13
  this.digitalWrite(13, 1);
});
```


## With johnny-five

```js
const BleIO = require("ble-io");
const five = require("johnny-five");

const board = new five.Board({
  io: new BleIO()
});

board.on("ready", function() {
  cosnt led = new five.Led(13);
  led.blink(500);
});
```

## TODO

* We need a way to query pin capabilities. Right now the code is assuming 20 pins all able to accept any pin mode.
* i2C support needs to be added as a new Characteristic to the reference firmware
